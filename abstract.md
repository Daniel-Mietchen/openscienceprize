# Everpub: reusable research, 21st century style

## Abstract

Modern research is strongly dependent on computational tools. In
biomedical research, computers are indispensible for analyzing large
amounts of data and for understanding complex models through
simulation. While the rapid advance of computing technology has
boosted progress in many fields of science, it has also created
barriers for scientific communication, which are particularly painful
in the ongoing transition to Open Science. Permitting other
researchers, let alone non-specialists, to fully understand complex research
requires not only publishing software and datasets, but also providing
a computational environment in which readers can explore these methods
easily by changing parameters and input data.

Over the last years, a large number of tools have been developed that
address specific aspects of this problem, and much valuable experience
has been gained from their use. However, orchestrating all these tools
for either producing or exploring published research requires a level of
technical competence that few scientists have or even wish to
acquire. We propose to drive a vertical spike through this problem
space, by integrating existing tools and methods into a unified whole
whose use requires no more technical expertise than performing
computations on a desktop computer. As a consequence, scientists will
be able to understand, evaluate, and re-use the work of
their peers.

We emphasize that we do not expect to provide a definitive solution to
the problem in the near future. Our immediate goal is to provide a
usable platform for publishing computer-aided research, which will
then be improved over time by bringing onboard scientists, librarians,
and publishers. We aim at building a community around these ideas,
which is a critical part of the success of the project. In addition to
_enabling_ Open Science, this project is also meant to be an _example_
of Open Science.
